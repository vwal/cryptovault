NOTE: The command files should use absolute paths to the vault file and the mount point so that the commands can be moved.

NOTE: Consider how sudo is implemented.. it must be dynamic, because if the command files are created by the root, 
      sudo would not be required, but then if root moves the command dir to a user's home dir, sudo may be required.
